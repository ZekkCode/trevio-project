# Contributing Guidelines

## Before You Start
1. Pull latest from `development`: `git pull origin development`
2. Check [docs/pembagian-tugas.md](docs/pembagian-tugas.md)
3. Make sure you're working on YOUR files only

## Workflow
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b your-name-feature`
2. Make changes
3. Commit often: `git commit -m "feat: description"`
4. Push: `git push origin your-name-feature`
5. Create PR to `dev` (NOT `main`)
6. Wait for Hendrik's review

## If You Need to Edit Someone Else's File
1. Ask in group chat FIRST
2. Coordinate with file owner
3. Mention in PR description

## Merge Conflict?
1. Don't panic
2. Ask Hendrik for help
3. Or: `git pull origin dev` → resolve conflicts → commit
